TODO for My Grunt Start

MVP:
* project scaffolding (src and dist)
* README with installation instructions
* project contributors should be able to run “npm install” and “grunt” from a fresh checkout without errors



Current task todos:
* grunt default task to fire up dev instance in browser
* grunt deploy task to minify and copy dev src to a dist folder, ready for stg/prod
- add build and dist to ignore lists
- research way to allow git clone without mapping back to remote (fork?)






POLISH:
- refine README to describe file structure
- deploy task(s) with SSH to stg/prod server(s) of dist
