TODO for My Grunt Start

MVP:
* project scaffolding (src and dist)
* README with installation instructions
- project contributors should be able to run “npm install” and “grunt” from a fresh checkout without errors
	-- paths to assets not working, may need to reconsider directory structure


User Stories:
* grunt default task to fire up dev instance in browser
- grunt build task to minify and copy dev src to a dist folder, ready for stg/prod




POLISH:
- refine README to describe file structure
- deploy task(s) with SSH to stg/prod server(s) of dist
